    <p>
      ‘Iziko’ is an isiXhosa word, meaning "a hearth". Since the hearth of a typical African homestead usually occupies the central space, Iziko symbolises both a hub of cultural activity, and a central place for gathering together South Africa’s diverse heritage.
      The Slave Lodge is one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town.
      In 1998 this museum was renamed the Slave Lodge. Under the umbrella theme, ‘From human wrongs to human rights, exhibitions on the lower level of this museum explore the long history of slavery in South Africa. Through our changing, temporary exhibitions we address issues around and raise awareness of human rights.

        <img src="20180301_132335.jpg" alt="Castle Of Goodhope"  class="CastleOfGoodhope">

         <p> This historical building now houses, among others, the William Fehr Collection, an African pottery collection, the Castle Military Museum and a forge.
         Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life at the Cape from approximately 1679.
         It is a story of joy, pain, tears, laughter, disappointment, fear, hope – and all the other human emotions that characterize us as a nation </p>

      <img src="20180301_133534.jpg" alt="GreenMarket">
      <ul>
        <p>Over the years, the square has served as a slave market, a vegetable market, a parking lot and more recently, a flea market trading mainly African souvenirs, crafts and curios. Near the centre of the square is a hand operated pump used to bring clean water to the surface from an underground river that runs through the city. During the apartheid era, Greenmarket Square was often the focus of political protests, due in part to its proximity to parliament, as well as the ethnicity of its traders and shoppers. </p>
